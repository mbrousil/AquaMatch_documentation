# DOC harmonization process

Following the completion of the {dataRetrieval} download process
described previously, the pipeline contains raw WQP data for each
parameter of interest. Before we harmonize each parameter we run through
a series of universal “pre-harmonization” steps, which ensure that the
datasets are appropriately formatted when entering their harmonization
routines.

The text below first walks through the pre-harmonization steps for the
raw dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dataset and then delves into the
specifics of the harmonization process.

## Pre-harmonization of the raw doc WQP dataset

At the start of the pre-harmonization process the raw DOC WQP dataset
contains 2.7 million rows.

<br>

### Missing results

Next, records that have missing data are dropped from the dataset.
Several criteria are used when checking for missing data. If any of the
below criteria are met the row is flagged as missing:

1.  Both the result column and detection limit column had `NA` data
2.  Result, result unit, activity comment, laboratory comment, and
    result comment columns are all `NA`
3.  The result comment column contains any user-provided text indicating
    a missing value, currently including: `analysis lost`,
    `not analyzed`, `not recorded`, `not collected`, or
    `no measurement taken`

94.7 thousand rows are dropped, resulting in a final count of 2.7
million.

<br>

### Filter status

The final step in pre-harmonization is to filter the
`ResultStatusIdentifier` column to include only the following statuses:

- `"Accepted"`
- `"Final"`
- `"Historical"`
- `"Validated"`
- `"Preliminary"`
- `NA`

These statuses generally indicate a reliable result having been reached,
however we also include `NA` in an effort to be conservative. More
specifically, when making decisions for this and other columns we
occasionally retain `NA` values if removing the records would otherwise
drop 10% or more of the available data.

This step removes 2037 rows of data, leaving it with 2.6 million rows
remaining.

<br>

## Harmonization-ready DOC dataset

Once ready for harmonization, the DOC WQP dataset contains the following
user-defined `characteristicNames`: Organic carbon, Total carbon,
Non-purgeable Organic Carbon (NPOC).

These names are chosen in order to select for only those measurements
that pertain to DOC.

<br>

### Filter media and fractions

We next ensure that the media type for all DOC data is
`"Surface Water"`, `"Water"`, `"Estuary"`, or `NA`. Additionally at this
step we select a subset of `CharacteristicName` and
`ResultSampleFractionText` combinations that are relevant to DOC. These
are:

<br>

| CharacteristicName                  | ResultSampleFractionText |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Non-purgeable Organic Carbon (NPOC) | Dissolved                |
| Non-purgeable Organic Carbon (NPOC) | Filtered, lab            |
| Non-purgeable Organic Carbon (NPOC) | None                     |
| Non-purgeable Organic Carbon (NPOC) | Total                    |
| Non-purgeable Organic Carbon (NPOC) | NA                       |
| Organic carbon                      | Dissolved                |
| Organic carbon                      | Filtered, lab            |
| Organic carbon                      | Filtered, field          |
| Organic carbon                      | Filterable               |
| Organic carbon                      | Total                    |
| Organic carbon                      | Organic                  |
| Total carbon                        | Filterable               |
| Total carbon                        | NA                       |
| Total carbon                        | Total                    |
| Total carbon                        | Organic                  |

<br>

Below are pie charts that break down the type of fractions dropped for
each CharacteristicName, including record counts:

#### Non-purgeable organic carbon (NPOC) fractions dropped

<br>

303 thousand rows are removed. The final row count after this is 2.3
million.

<br>

### Document and remove fails

In this step we filter out records based on indications that they have
failed data quality assurance or quality control for some reason given
by the data provider (these instances are referred to here as
“failures”).

After reviewing the contents of the `ActivityCommentText`,
`ResultLaboratoryCommentText`, `ResultCommentText`,
`ResultDetectionConditionText`, and `ResultMeasureValue_original`
columns, we developed a list of terms that captured the majority of
instances where records had failures or unacceptable measurements.
(Note: `ResultMeasureValue_original` is a duplicate, character version
of the `ResultMeasureValue` column that we use as a reference for the
column’s contents before it was converted to a numeric type.) We found
the phrasing to be consistent across columns and so we searched for the
same (case agnostic) terms in all four locations. The terms are: “beyond
accept”, “cancelled”, “contaminat”, “error”, “fail”, “improper”,
“interference”, “invalid”, “no result”, “no test”, “not accept”,
“outside of accept”, “problem”, “questionable”, “suspect”, “unable”,
“violation”, “reject”, “no data”, “time exceed”, “value extrapolated”,
“exceeds”, “biased”, “parameter not required”, “not visited”.

Below are pie charts that break down the number of failure detections by
column. Note that the plotting below is automated so if one or more of
the columns listed above are not plotted, this indicates that the
column(s) did not return any matches for the failure phrases. Also note
that a single record can contain multiple failure phrases; therefore,
failure phrases are not mutually exclusive.

<br>

#### ActivityCommentText fail detects

<img src="in/doc/doc_ActivityCommentText_fail_pie.png" alt="ActivityCommentText failure detects" width="650"/>

#### ResultCommentText fail detects

<img src="in/doc/doc_ResultCommentText_fail_pie.png" alt="ResultCommentText failure detects" width="650"/>

#### ResultLaboratoryCommentText fail detects

<img src="in/doc/doc_ResultLaboratoryCommentText_fail_pie.png" alt="ResultLaboratoryCommentText failure detects" width="650"/>

<br>

#### ResultDetectionConditionText fail detects

#### ResultMeasureValue_original fail detects

<img src="in/doc/doc_ResultMeasureValue_original_fail_pie.png" alt="ResultMeasureValue_original failure detects" width="650"/>

<br>

58.5 thousand rows are removed after detecting failure-related phrases
and 2.3 million rows remain.

<br>

### Clean MDLs

In this step method detection limits (MDLs) are used to clean up the
reported values. When a numeric value is missing for the data record
(i.e., `NA` or text that became `NA` during an `as.numeric` call) we
check for non-detect language in the `ResultLaboratoryCommentText`,
`ResultCommentText`, `ResultDetectionConditionText`, and
`ResultMeasureValue` columns. This language can be `"non-detect"`,
`"not detect"`, `"non detect"`, `"undetect"`, or `"below"`.

If non-detect language exists then we use the
`DetectionQuantitationLimitMeasure.MeasureValue` column for the MDL,
otherwise if there is a `<` and a number in the `ResultMeasureValue`
column we use that number instead.

We then use a random number between 0 and `0.5 * MDL` as the record’s
value moving forward.

We produce a new column, `mdl_flag`, from the MDL cleaning process.
Records where no MDL-based adjustment was made and which are at or above
the MDL are assigned a 0. Records with corrected values based on the MDL
method are assigned a 1. Finally, records where no MDL-based adjustment
was made and which contain a numeric value below the provided MDL are
assigned a 2.

This should not result in a change in rows but we still check: 0 rows
are removed. The final row count after this is 2.3 million.

![](/Users/mbrousil/Documents/AquaMatch_documentation/chapters/05_doc_harmonization_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)<!-- -->

<br>

### Clean approximate values

Cleaning approximate values involves a similar process as for MDL
cleaning. We flag “approximated” values in the dataset. The
`ResultMeasureValue` column gets checked for **all** three of the
following conditions:

1.  Numeric-only version of the column is still `NA` after MDL cleaning
2.  The original column text contained a number
3.  Any of `ResultLaboratoryCommentText`, `ResultCommentText`, or
    `ResultDetectionConditionText` match this regular expression,
    ignoring case: `"result approx|RESULT IS APPROX|value approx"`

We then use the approximate value as the record’s value moving forward.

Records with corrected values based on the above method are noted with a
1 in the `approx_flag` column. Note, however, that occasionally
approximate language will be used in a record but not changed or
flagged. This occurs when the language is used in a comment-related
column and **not** the result column itself, meaning that there is a
usable numeric value provided (and thus doesn’t need correction).

This should not result in a change in rows but we still check: 0 rows
are removed. The final row count after this is 2.3 million.

![](/Users/mbrousil/Documents/AquaMatch_documentation/chapters/05_doc_harmonization_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)<!-- -->

<br>

### Clean values with “greater than” data

The next step is similar to the MDL and approximate value cleaning
processes, and follows the approximate cleaning process most closely.
The goal is to clean up values that were entered as “greater than” some
value. The `ResultMeasureValue` column gets checked for **all** three of
the following conditions:

1.  Numeric-only version of the column is still `NA` after MDL &
    approximate cleaning
2.  The original column text contained a number
3.  The original column text contained a `>`

We then use the “greater than” value (without `>`) as the record’s value
moving forward.

Records with corrected values based on the above method are noted with a
1 in the `greater_flag` column.

This should not result in a change in rows but we still check: 0 rows
are removed. The final row count after this is 2.3 million.

![](/Users/mbrousil/Documents/AquaMatch_documentation/chapters/05_doc_harmonization_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)<!-- -->

<br>

### Drop unresolved NA measurements

The goal of the preceding three steps was to prevent records with
seemingly missing measurement data from being dropped if there was still
a chance of recovering a usable value. At this point we’ve finished with
that process and we proceed to check for remaining records with `NA`
values in their `harmonized_value` column. If they exist, they are
dropped. We also filter out any negative values in the dataset at this
point.

3920 rows are removed. The final row count after this is 2.3 million.

<br>

### Harmonize record units

The next step in doc harmonization is converting the units of WQP
records. We create the following conversion table, which is used to
translate units provided in WQP into mg per liter (mg/L):

<table class=" lightable-paper table" style="font-family: &quot;Arial Narrow&quot;, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

dropped in the unit harmonization process, and how many records were
lost with each code.

million.

### Clean depth data

The next harmonization step cleans the four depth-related columns
obtained from the WQP. The details behind this step are covered in the
*Depth flags* section of the *Tiering, flagging, and quality control
philosophy* chapter.

This should not result in a change in rows but we still check: 0 rows
are removed. The final row count after this is 2.3 million.

![](/Users/mbrousil/Documents/AquaMatch_documentation/chapters/05_doc_harmonization_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png)<!-- -->

<br>

### Filter and tier methods

We next review the analytical methods used in measuring DOC, primarily
by classifying the text provided with each record in
`ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName`. Once these methods are classified
we arrange them into hierarchical tiers as described in the *Method
tiering* section of the *Tiering, flagging, and quality control
philosophy* chapter.

However, prior to classification we check the
`ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName` column for names that indicate
non-DOC measurements. Phrases used to flag and remove unrelated methods
from DOC data are: “Oxygen”, “Nitrogen”, “Ammonia”, “Metals”, “E. coli”,
“Anion”, “Cation”, “Phosphorus”, “Silica”, “PH”, “HARDNESS”, “Nutrient”,
“Turbidity”, “Nitrate”, “Conductance”, “Alkalinity”, “Chlorophyll”,
“Solids”, “Temperature”, “Color in Water”, “Coliform”, “PARTICULATE
CARBON (inorg+org)”, “5210”, “bed sed”, “bs, calc”, “5220”,
“Suspended-Sediment in Water”.

This process drops 82.9 thousand rows leaving 2.2 million remaining.

The next step towards creating tiers is to then classify the methods in
`ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName` into either: Combustion + infrared
methods, Persulfate-UV/Heated Persulfate Oxidation+IR detection methods,
Wet Oxidation+Persulfate+IR methods, Elemental Analyzer methods, or
Carbonaceous Analyzer methods. These classifications are not the final
tiers, but they inform the tiering in the final step of this process.
The criteria for each of the above classifications are:

- **Combustion+IR:** Detection of “5310 B”, “5310B”, “415.1”,
  “combustion” but only without “5310 C” or “5310C”, “0.45u silver,
  persulfate IR”, “0.7 um GFF, combust IR”, “Laboratory Procedures for
  Water Quality Chemical Analysis”, “CO2 formation”, “Qian & Mopper
  1996”, or “Shimadzu TOC Analyzer” in
  `ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName`
- **Persulfate-UV/Heated Persulfate Oxidation+IR:** Detection of “5310
  C”, “5310C”, “persulfate oxid”, “415.2”, “Ultraviolet”,
  “Heated-Persulfate”, or “UV” in `ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName`
- **Wet Oxidation+Persulfate+IR detection:** Detection of “0.45 ?um
  cap”, “0.45um cap”, “wet oxidation”, “5310 D”, “5310D”, “415.3”,
  “O-3100 ~ Total Organic Carbon in Water” in
  `ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName`
- **Elemental Analyzer:** Detection of “440” in
  `ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName`
- **Carbonaceous Analyzer:** Detection of “9060 A” in
  `ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName`

Finally, we group the data into three tiers as described in *Tiering,
flagging, and quality control philosophy*. These tiers are:

<br>

<!-- Table created with https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables -->

| Tier | Name        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | DOC details                                                                                                                                            |     |
|------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|
| 0    | Restrictive | Data that are verifiably self-similar across organizations and time-periods and can be considered highly reliable and interoperable                                                                                                                                                                    | Includes records using Wet Oxidation+Persulfate+IR (EPA 415.3, SM 5310D) or Persulfate-UV/Heated Persulfate Oxidation+IR (EPA 415.2, SM 5310C) methods |     |
| 1    | Narrowed    | Data that we have good reason to believe are self-similar, but for which we can’t verify full interoperability across data providers                                                                                                                                                                   | Includes records using combustion+IR (EPA 415.1, SM 5310B) or elemental analyzer methods (EPA 440)                                                     |     |
| 2    | Inclusive   | Data that are assumed to be reliable and are harmonized to our best ability given the information available from the data provider. This tier includes `NA` or non-resolvable descriptions for the analytical method, which often make up the majority of methods descriptions for any given parameter | Carbonaceous (EPA 9060A) and all other records by default, including `NA` methods                                                                      |     |

<br>

At this point we export a file
(`3_harmonize/out/doc_tiering_record.csv`) that contains a record of how
specific method text was tiered and how many row counts corresponded to
each method.

<br>

![](/Users/mbrousil/Documents/AquaMatch_documentation/chapters/05_doc_harmonization_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png)<!-- -->

<br>

### Flag based on field methods

DOC doesn’t have field sampling methods that lend themselves well to
comparing with analytical methods and assigning flags, unlike variables
like chlorophyll *a*. We fill the `field_flag` column with `NA` for “not
applicable” for DOC.

No records should be removed by this process and so there are 0 rows
dropped leaving 2.2 million remaining in the harmonized DOC dataset.

![](/Users/mbrousil/Documents/AquaMatch_documentation/chapters/05_doc_harmonization_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png)<!-- -->

<br>

### Miscellaneous flag

Next we add a placeholder for the miscellaneous flag column,
`misc_flag`.

Similarly to the `field_flag` column, this will be filled with `NA`.
Some parameters will have additional flagging requirements that DOC does
not, so we include this placeholder to maintain the same columns across
all parameter data products.

No records should be removed by this process and so there are 0 rows
dropped leaving 2.2 million remaining in the harmonized DOC dataset.

![](/Users/mbrousil/Documents/AquaMatch_documentation/chapters/05_doc_harmonization_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png)<!-- -->

<br>

### Remove unrealistic values

Before finalizing the dataset we remove DOC values that are beyond a
realistic threshold. We use 300 mg/L as our cutoff for removal as
typical values are often less than 120 mg/L (Hotchkiss and DelSontro,
2024) but values of 300 mg/L occur in some climates (Mulholland, 2003).

We also remove any depths \> 592m, the deepest point in a lake in the
U.S.

19.6 thousand rows are removed. The final row count after this is 2.2
million.

![](/Users/mbrousil/Documents/AquaMatch_documentation/chapters/05_doc_harmonization_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-33-1.png)<!-- -->

<br>

### Aggregate simultaneous records

The final step of DOC harmonization is to aggregate simultaneous
observations. Any group of samples determined to be simultaneous are
simplified into a single record containing the mean and coefficient of
variation (CV) of the group. These can be either true duplicate entries
in the WQP or records with non-identical values recorded at the same
time and place and by the same organization (field and/or lab
replicates/duplicates). The CV can be used to filter the dataset based
on the amount of variability that is tolerable to specific use cases.
Note, however, that many entries will have a CV that is `NA` because
there are no simultaneous records or 0 because the records are
duplicates and all entries have the same `harmonized_value`.

We identify simultaneous records to aggregate by creating identical
subgroups (`subgroup_id`) from the following columns: `parameter`,
`OrganizationIdentifier`, `MonitoringLocationIdentifier`,
`MonitoringLocationTypeName`, `ResolvedMonitoringLocationTypeName`,
`ActivityStartDate`, `ActivityStartDateTime`,
`ActivityStartTime.TimeZoneCode`, `harmonized_tz`, `harmonized_utc`,
`harmonized_top_depth_value`, `harmonized_top_depth_unit`,
`harmonized_bottom_depth_value`, `harmonized_bottom_depth_unit`,
`harmonized_discrete_depth_value`, `harmonized_discrete_depth_unit`,
`depth_flag`, `mdl_flag`, `approx_flag`, `greater_flag`, `tier`,
`field_flag`, `misc_flag`, `harmonized_units`. This selection limits the
columns included in the final dataset, but we also provide a copy of the
AquaMatch dataset prior to its aggregation (pipeline target
`p3_doc_preagg_grouped`), and include the `subgroup_id` column, so that
users can use the disaggregated data as well and match make joins
between dataset versions.

The final, aggregated values are presented in the `harmonized_value` and
`harmonized_value_cv` columns. The number of rows used per group is
recorded in the `harmonized_row_count` column.

0.3 million rows dropped leaving 1.8 million remaining in the final
harmonized and aggregated doc dataset.

### Harmonized DOC

At this point the harmonization of the DOC data from the WQP is complete
and we export the final dataset for use later in the workflow.

Below are several sets of figures illustrating different qualities of
the dataset:

1.  Histograms showing the distribution of harmonized measurements (top)
    and CVs (bottom) broken down by `tier` ***after*** aggregating
    simultaneous records.

2.  Maps showing the geographic distribution of records by tier within
    the US:

3.  Lastly, bar charts showing the distribution of values by tier across
    years, months, and days of the week:
