# TSS harmonization process

Following the completion of the {dataRetrieval} download process
described previously, the pipeline contains raw WQP data for each
parameter of interest. Before we harmonize each parameter we run through
a series of universal “pre-harmonization” steps, which ensure that the
datasets are appropriately formatted when entering their harmonization
routines.

The text below first walks through the pre-harmonization steps for the
total suspended solids (TSS) dataset and then delves into the specifics
of the harmonization process.

## Pre-harmonization of the raw TSS WQP dataset

At the start of the pre-harmonization process the raw TSS WQP dataset
contains 6 million rows.

</figure>

<br>

### Missing results

Next, records that have missing data are dropped from the dataset.
Several criteria are used when checking for missing data. If any of the
below criteria are met the row is flagged as missing:

1.  Both the result column and detection limit column had `NA` data
2.  Result, result unit, activity comment, laboratory comment, and
    result comment columns are all `NA`
3.  The result comment column contains any user-provided text indicating
    a missing value. This currently includes: `analysis lost`,
    `not analyzed`, `not recorded`, `not collected`, or
    `no measurement taken`

201.3 thousand rows are dropped, resulting in a final count of 5.8
million.

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Bar plot showing the row count update for

</figure>

<br>

### Filter status

The final step in pre-harmonization is to filter the
`ResultStatusIdentifier` column to include only the following statuses:

- `"Accepted"`
- `"Final"`
- `"Historical"`
- `"Validated"`
- `"Preliminary"`
- `NA`

These statuses generally indicate a reliable result was obtained,
however we also include `NA` in an effort to be conservative. More
specifically, when making decisions for this and other columns we
occasionally retain `NA` values if removing the records would otherwise
drop 10% or more of the available data.

This step removes 14.7 thousand rows of data, leaving it with 5.8
million rows remaining.

## Harmonization-ready TSS dataset

Once ready for harmonization, the TSS WQP dataset contains the following
user-defined `characteristicNames`: Total suspended solids, Total
Particulate Matter, Suspended Sediment Concentration (SSC).

These `characteristicNames` are chosen in order to select for only those
measurements that pertain to TSS.

<br>

### Filter media and fractions

We next ensure that the media type for all TSS data is
`"Surface Water"`, `"Water"`, `"Estuary"`, or `NA`. 4.2 thousand rows
are removed. The final row count after this is 5.8 million.

<br>

### Document and remove fails

In this step we filter out records based on indications that they have
failed data quality assurance or quality control for some reason given
by the data provider (these instances are referred to here as
“failures”).

After reviewing the contents of the `ActivityCommentText`,
`ResultLaboratoryCommentText`, `ResultCommentText`,
`ResultDetectionConditionText`, and `ResultMeasureValue_original`
columns, we developed a list of terms that captured the majority of
instances where records had failures or unacceptable measurements.
(Note: `ResultMeasureValue_original` is a duplicate, character version
of the `ResultMeasureValue` column that we use as a reference for the
column’s contents before it was converted to a numeric type.) We found
the phrasing to be consistent across columns, so we searched for the
same (case agnostic) terms in all four locations. The terms are: “beyond
accept”, “cancelled”, “contaminat”, “error”, “fail”, “improper”,
“interference”, “invalid”, “no result”, “no test”, “not accept”,
“outside of accept”, “problem”, “questionable”, “suspect”, “unable”,
“violation”, “reject”, “no data”, “time exceed”, “value extrapolated”,
“exceeds”, “biased”, “parameter not required”, “not visited”.

Below are pie charts that break down the number of failure detections by
column. Note that the plotting below is automated so if one or more of
the columns listed above are not plotted, this indicates that the
column(s) did not return any matches for the failure phrases. Also note
that a single record can contain multiple failure phrases; therefore,
failure phrases are not mutually exclusive.

<br>

#### ActivityCommentText fail detects

#### ResultMeasureValue_original fail detects

<br>

60.1 thousand rows are removed after detecting failure-related phrases
and 5.8 million rows remain.

<br>

### Clean MDLs

In this step method detection limits (MDLs) are used to clean up the
reported values. When a numeric value is missing for the data record
(i.e., `NA` or text that became `NA` during an `as.numeric` call) we
check for non-detect language in the `ResultLaboratoryCommentText`,
`ResultCommentText`, `ResultDetectionConditionText`, and
`ResultMeasureValue` columns. This language can be `"non-detect"`,
`"not detect"`, `"non detect"`, `"undetect"`, or `"below"`.

If non-detect language exists then we use the
`DetectionQuantitationLimitMeasure.MeasureValue` column for the MDL.
Otherwise if there is a `<` and a number in the `ResultMeasureValue`
column, we use that number instead.

We then use a random number between 0 and `0.5 * MDL` as the record’s
value moving forward.

We produce a new column, `mdl_flag`, from the MDL cleaning process.
Records where no MDL-based adjustment was made and which are at or above
the MDL are assigned a 0. Records with corrected values based on the MDL
method are assigned a 1. Finally, records where no MDL-based adjustment
was made and which contain a numeric value below the provided MDL are
assigned a 2.

This should not result in a change in rows, but we still check: 0 rows
are removed. The final row count after this is 5.8 million.

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Bar plot showing the row count update for

</figure>

<br>

### Clean approximate values

Cleaning approximate values involves a similar process as for MDL
cleaning. We flag “approximated” values in the dataset. The
`ResultMeasureValue` column gets checked for **all** three of the
following conditions:

1.  Numeric-only version of the column is still `NA` after MDL cleaning
2.  The original column text contained a number
3.  Any of `ResultLaboratoryCommentText`, `ResultCommentText`, or
    `ResultDetectionConditionText` match this regular expression,
    ignoring case: `"result approx|RESULT IS APPROX|value approx"`

We then use the approximate value as the record’s value moving forward.

Records with corrected values based on the above method are noted with a
1 in the `approx_flag` column. Note, however, that occasionally
approximate language will be used in a record but not changed or
flagged. This occurs when the language is used in a comment-related
column and **not** the result column itself, meaning that there is a
usable numeric value provided (and thus doesn’t need correction).

This should not result in a change in rows, but we still check: 0 rows
are removed. The final row count after this is 5.8 million.

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Bar plot showing the row count update for

</figure>

<br>

### Clean values with “greater than” data

The next step is similar to the MDL and approximate value cleaning
processes, and follows the approximate cleaning process most closely.
The goal is to clean up values that were entered as “greater than” some
value. The `ResultMeasureValue` column gets checked for **all** three of
the following conditions:

1.  Numeric-only version of the column is still `NA` after MDL &
    approximate cleaning
2.  The original column text contained a number
3.  The original column text contained a `>`

We then use the “greater than” value (without `>`) as the record’s value
moving forward.

Records with corrected values based on the above method are noted with a
1 in the `greater_flag` column.

This should not result in a change in rows, but we still check: 0 rows
are removed. The final row count after this is 5.8 million.

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Bar plot showing the row count update for

</figure>

<br>

### Drop unresolved NA measurements

The goal of the preceding three steps was to prevent records with
seemingly missing measurement data from being dropped if there was still
a chance of recovering a usable value. At this point we’ve finished with
that process and we proceed to check for remaining records with `NA`
values in their `harmonized_value` column. If they exist, they are
dropped. We also filter out any negative values in the dataset at this
point because TSS cannot be negative.

15.2 thousand rows are removed. The final row count after this is 5.8
million.

### Harmonize record units

The next step in TSS harmonization is converting the units of WQP
records. Records that don’t make sense for TSS or can’t be converted to
mg per liter (mg/L) are dropped. We use the following unit conversion
table for this:

<table class=" lightable-paper table" style="font-family: &quot;Arial Narrow&quot;, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

dropped in the unit harmonization process, and how many records were
lost with each code.

829.7 thousand rows are removed. The final row count after this is 4.9
million.

### Clean depth data

The next harmonization step cleans the four depth-related columns
obtained from the WQP. The details behind this step are covered in the
*Depth flags* section of the *Tiering, flagging, and quality control
philosophy* chapter.

This should not result in a change in rows, but we still check: 0 rows
are removed. The final row count after this is 4.9 million.

<br>

### Filter and tier methods

We next review the analytical methods used in measuring TSS, primarily
by classifying the text provided with each record in
`ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName`. Once these methods are classified
we arrange them into hierarchical tiers as described in the *Method
tiering* section of the *Tiering, flagging, and quality control
philosophy* chapter.

However, prior to classification we check the
`ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName` column for names that indicate
non-TSS measurements. Phrases used to flag and remove unrelated methods
from TSS data are: “10200”, “150.1”, “2340”, “2550”, “4500”, “9222”,
“9223”, “Alkalinity”, “Chlorophyll”, “DO NOT USE”, “Mercury”, “Nitrate”,
“Nitrogen”, “Oxygen”, “Phosphorus”, “Temperature”, “Silica”.

We additionally remove samples that indicate being collected from
flowing waters during a “no flow” period. We check for phrases matching
“no flow”, “not flow”, or “zero flow” in `ActivityCommentText` **in
addition to** `MonitoringLocationTypeName` entries matching “river”,
“stream”, or “canal”.

The above two processes drop 10 thousand rows, leaving 4.9 million
remaining.

The next step towards creating tiers is to then identify the analytical
methods in `ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName` that:

- **Indicate non-surface sampling**: This includes detection of
  “Activity Relative Depth: Bottom”, “Activity Relative Depth: Near
  Bottom”, “Activity Relative Depth: Midwater”, “Relative Depth = Below
  Thermocline”, or “hypolimnion” in `ActivityCommentText` or “pump”,
  “peristaltic”, “niskin”, “van dorn”, or “Kemmerer” in
  `SampleCollectionEquipmentName`.
- **Have `NA` values in `ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName` or
  `SampleCollectionEquipmentName`**
- **Indicate low-flow conditions**: This includes detection of “low
  flow”, “no flow”, “no visible flow”, “low stream flow”, “Flow: Low”,
  “Not flowing”, “low visible flow”, “slow flow”, “BELOW NORMAL”,
  “Gentle flow”, “NO DISCERNIBLE FLOW”, or “Low base flow” in
  `ActivityCommentText` with **no** detection of “too deep” or “high
  flow”.
- **Have
  `[USGSPCode](https://help.waterdata.usgs.gov/codes-and-parameters/parameters)`
  or `ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName` values typical of TSS or SSC
  (Suspended Sediment Concentration)**: Includes “2540”, “160”, “ASTM”,
  “14B”, “8006”, or “108” in `ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName` or
  “00530”, “80154”, “70299”, “70293”, “69613”, “69586”, “69587”,
  “69588”, “69584”, “69581”, “69582”, “69585”, “69583”, “69580”,
  “69579”, “70292” in `USGSPCode`.
- **Have `ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName` values that are less
  reliable TSS analytical methods**: Includes detection of “GCLAS”,
  “I-3765-85”, or “Nephelometry”
- **Have 15 or fewer records associated with them**

These classifications are not the final tiers, but they inform the
tiering in the final step of this process.

Finally, we group the data into three tiers as described in *Tiering,
flagging, and quality control philosophy*. These tiers are:

This tier includes NA or non-resolvable descriptions for the analytical method, which often make up the majority of methods descriptions for any given parameter | Includes records that meet one of the following criteria: Have NA values in ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName or SampleCollectionEquipmentName; have ActivityCommentText values indicating low-flow conditions; are TSS samples that were taken at depth or with a pump; are non-USGS, SSC samples that were **not** taken at depth or with a pump; or have ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName values with 15 or fewer total records and which are not clearly standard SSC or TSS methods. We checked for sampling at depth or with a pump by checking for records that mention “pump”, “peristaltic”, “niskin”, “van dorn”, or “Kemmerer” in the SampleCollectionEquipmentName column or have one of the following phrases in the ActivityCommentText column: “Activity Relative Depth: Bottom”, “Activity Relative Depth: Near Bottom”, “Activity Relative Depth: Midwater”, “Relative Depth = Below Thermocline”, “hypolimnion”. |

<br>

At this point we export a file (`in/tss/tss_tiering_record.csv`) that
contains a record of how specific method text was tiered and how many
row counts corresponded to each method.

### Flag based on field methods

Next, we use the `field_flag` column to flag records that have a
qualifier related to sampling depth:

- `field_flag` = `1` when:
  - TSS was sampled at depth, or
  - non-USGS SSC was **not** sampled at depth
- In all other cases `field_flag` is 0

Sampling at depth is determined by whether the record was highlighted as
indicating non-surface sampling during the previous harmonization step.

No records should be removed by this process and so there are 0 rows
dropped leaving 4.9 million remaining in the harmonized TSS dataset.

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Bar plot showing the row count update for

</figure>

<br>

### Miscellaneous flag

Next, we add a placeholder for the miscellaneous flag column,
`misc_flag`.

This will be filled with `NA` for TSS. Some parameters will have
additional flagging requirements that TSS does not, so we include this
placeholder to maintain the same columns across all parameter data
products.

No records should be removed by this process and so there are 0 rows
dropped leaving 4.9 million remaining in the harmonized TSS dataset.

### Remove unrealistic values

Before finalizing the dataset we remove TSS values that are beyond a
realistic threshold. We use 10,000 mg/L as our cutoff for removal. This
is based on values from Gray et al. (2000), *“Comparability of
suspended-sediment concentration and total suspended solids data”*. SSC
values in SSC-TSS pairs in the Gray et al. dataset were below 10,000
with one exception and most TSS values were lower than their paired SSC
value.

We also remove any depths \> 592m, the deepest point in a lake in the
U.S.

25 thousand rows are removed. The final row count after this is 4.9
million.

### Aggregate simultaneous records

The final step of TSS harmonization is to aggregate simultaneous
observations. Prior to aggregation, the dataset has the following
distribution of values when organized by `CharacteristicName` and
`ProviderName`:

<br>

<img src="in/tss/tss_charname_dists.png" alt="Distribution of TSS values by CharacteristicName and ProviderName" width="650"/>

<br>

**The aggregation process**: Any group of samples determined to be
simultaneous are simplified into a single record containing the mean and
coefficient of variation (CV) of the group. These can be either true
duplicate entries in the WQP or records with non-identical values
recorded at the same time and place and by the same organization (field
and/or lab replicates/duplicates). The CV can be used to filter the
dataset based on the amount of variability that is tolerable to specific
use cases. Note, however, that many entries will have a CV that is `NA`
because there are no simultaneous records or 0 because the records are
duplicates and all entries have the same `harmonized_value`.

We identify simultaneous records to aggregate by creating identical
subgroups (`subgroup_id`) from the following columns: `parameter`,
`OrganizationIdentifier`, `MonitoringLocationIdentifier`,
`MonitoringLocationTypeName`, `ResolvedMonitoringLocationTypeName`,
`ActivityStartDate`, `ActivityStartDateTime`,
`ActivityStartTime.TimeZoneCode`, `harmonized_tz`, `harmonized_utc`,
`harmonized_top_depth_value`, `harmonized_top_depth_unit`,
`harmonized_bottom_depth_value`, `harmonized_bottom_depth_unit`,
`harmonized_discrete_depth_value`, `harmonized_discrete_depth_unit`,
`depth_flag`, `mdl_flag`, `approx_flag`, `greater_flag`, `tier`,
`field_flag`, `misc_flag`, `harmonized_units`. This selection limits the
columns included in the final dataset, but we also provide a copy of the
AquaMatch dataset prior to its aggregation (pipeline target
`p3_tss_preagg_grouped`), and include the `subgroup_id` column, so that
users can use the disaggregated data as well and match make joins
between dataset versions.

The final, aggregated values are presented in the `harmonized_value` and
`harmonized_value_cv` columns. The number of rows used per group is
recorded in the `harmonized_row_count` column.

0.3 million rows dropped leaving 4.6 million remaining in the final
harmonized and aggregated TSS dataset.

### Harmonized TSS

At this point the harmonization of the TSS data from the WQP is complete
and we export the final dataset for use later in the workflow.

Below are several sets of figures illustrating different qualities of
the dataset:

1.  Histograms showing the distribution of harmonized measurements (top)
    and CVs (bottom) broken down by `tier` ***after*** aggregating
    simultaneous records.
